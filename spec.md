\large{\underline{Overview:}}  
Imgag is quite possibly the greatest image sharing website ever conceived. It's users may share images, and rate them according to their greatness. By using an ingenious algorithm (score = upvotes - downvotes) we can assure our users they will only see the BEST images from across the world.  

In the unlikely event our algorithm does not show the best images possible, we also offer categories of images, so Imgag's users may see exactly what they desire.  

Users are incentivised to upload incredible images indefinitely, as they will see their score increase as people rate their uploaded images.

\  \   
\underline{Persona One - Petar}  
Meet Petar. Petar is a university student who loves to procastinate and waste time on social media looking at memes but is not able to find the satisfaction due to
an increase in number of emotional and "cute animal posts" the sites are offering. He wishes to find something better than 9gag or imgur
where he can rate on pictures and add his very valuable yet supportive critisism of "git gud scrub" if the memes are not upto his standards.  

\  

\underline{Persona Two - Dimitri}  
This is Dimitri. Dimitiri has the sole responsibility to handle all the IT work at a local coffee shop.
He is very self obsessed and loves to get attention from everyone. He wants to use a platform where he can upload numerous amounts of pictures of himself in various categories
which can be featured on the home page itself but is currently very disappointed by the censorship these websites enforces.
