\large{\underline{Overview}}  
Imgag is quite possibly the greatest image sharing website ever concieved. It's users may share images, and rate them according to their greatness. By using an ingenious algorithm (score = upvotes - downvotes) we can assure our users they will only see the BEST images from across the world.  

In the unlikely event our algorithm does not show the best images, we also offer categories of images, so Imgag's users may see exactly what they desire.  

Users are incentivised to upload incredible images indefinitely, as they will see their score as people rate their uploaded images.

Users can:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Upload and delete images}
\item{Create accounts}
\item{Like and dislike image posts}
\item{View images}
\item{View categories of images}
\end{itemize}
